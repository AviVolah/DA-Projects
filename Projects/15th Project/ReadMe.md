# Product Range Analysis

This project analyzes the product range of an ecommerce store using one year of invoice data to explore buyer habits, create and analyze categories, and explore possible seasonal trends. The project includes a detailed analysis of the research in the `product_range_final.ipynb` notebook.

## Data Description
- `ecommerce_dataset_us.csv`: invoice log
    - InvoiceNo: order identifier
    - StockCode: item identifier
    - Description: item name
    - Quantity: quantity ordered
    - InvoiceDate: order date
    - UnitPrice: price per item
    - CustomerID: customer identifier

## Summary
### Methodology
- Data cleaning & processing
    - Identified stock code with multiple descriptions and vice versa.
    - Remaining descriptions were cleaned and used to create 1:1 table of stock codes and product names. This table was used to populate the "name" column with clean product names.
    - Removed all irrelevant data from the data frame.
- Product categorization
    - Categories were planned around common categories and subcategories found on large retailer websites.
- Invoice analysis
    - Aggregated invoice data to understand customer purchasing habits (frequency, purchase volume, total purchase amount, product diversity).
    - Aggregated product data and explored relationships between purchase frequency, purchase volume, total price.
- Category analysis
    - Aggregated category data and explored relationships between several sales metrics (units, order count, total sales, avg sales, etc).
    - Identified the top performing categories and tracked their sales trends over time. Investigated significant changes in category performance.
- Hypothesis testing
    - checked if longer description affects the item sales

### Conclusions
Based on the data and the analysis i did there are 3 points i arrived at:

- Best remove all the items in the bad_sc list and double down on the top_sc list
- Make reccomendations to buy other cake cases when there is a purchase of a cake case
- There is no significant correlation between the desc length and any sale metric, but the highest is to profit, and from conducting a statistical test, its better to shorten the descriptions
#### Added:
- Sales are greatly impacted by seasonal trends, particularly in autumn when almost all categories experience increased growth. To prepare for this, businesses should not only acquire extra stock but also diversify the options available across all categories.
- Tracking sales by both category and subcategory is crucial in anticipating sudden changes in demand throughout the year and keeping products relevant.
- Categories related to the home, such as decor, kitchen, tableware, and storage, are more stable, while other categories are more susceptible to seasonal changes. To optimize inventory planning, businesses should create a calendar that prioritizes specific holidays and seasonal changes. When subcategories are experiencing upward trends, it is important to focus on adding variety to those subcategories, as more options lead to increased sales.
